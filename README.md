- Setting up and using Express in a Node.js application.
- Implementing user authentication.
- Using middleware for request processing.
- Interacting with a PostgreSQL database for CRUD operations


## Features
- User Authentication: Register and log in users securely.
- Middleware: Custom middleware implementation for route protection and other utilities.
- PostgreSQL Integration: Storing and retrieving data, including user information, chat messages, and chat lobbies.
